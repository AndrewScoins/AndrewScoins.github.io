## Professional Experience

### *2022-Present* GMV

#### Navigation Engineer

- Designed and delivered software for the control of, and visualisation of data received from, connected GNSS hardware using C#.
- Designed and implemented a serial-communication module able to receive and transmit over a number of serial connections via a range of communications protocols, including NMEA.
- Analysed frequency spectrum data to assess performance of GNSS-related hardware; developed automated tools in Python to assist.
- Constructed automated data post-processing and visualisation software tools for GNSS simulations, using Python.
- Developed data-fusion algorithms for a multi-sensor navigation system, using MATLAB.

### *2017-2021* Centre for Particle Theory, Durham University, UK

#### PhD Mathematical Sciences

##### Thesis: *Black Holes with Topological Defects; The C-Metric in Three and Four Dimensions*

- Used computational and analytical techniques to examine the effects of accelerating both isolated and coupled black holes in a variety of contexts.
- Constructed novel mathematical models for black holes as thermodynamic systems.
- Using C++, programmed a variety of numerical partial differential equation solvers for the analysis of gravitating, dynamical systems. In particular, computed the gravitational fields of astrophysical systems and the resultant orbits of satellites confined therein.

### *2015* Quantum Gravity Laboratory, University of Nottingham, UK

#### Research Funded by the London Mathematical Society

##### Project: *Hydrodynamic Simulations of Rotating Black Holes*

- Performed laboratory experiment to verify the results of a simulated hydrodynamic system.
- Developed bespoke software for instrumentation.
- Implemented and tuned image processing algorithms to perform particle tracking velocimetry.

### *2013-2017* School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham, UK
