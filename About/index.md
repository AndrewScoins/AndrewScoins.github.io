# About Me

![headshot](/resources/headshot.jpg)

I'm a software developer with the graphics team at [Datapath](https://www.datapath.co.uk/).

Throughout my career, I've had the great privilege to work in a range of exciting fields from scientific simulation and control systems design, to full-stack application development.

I have an academic background is in high-energy theoretical physics, having attained a PhD from [Durham University, UK](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/mathematical-sciences/).
My scientific interests have included the thermodynamic properties of black holes, the relationship between gravitational theories and quantum field theories, and trajectory computation in strong gravitational fields.
