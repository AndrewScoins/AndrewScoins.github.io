# About Me

I'm a scientific software developer and navigational systems algorithm
engineer at [GMV](https://www.gmv.com/en). My work covers both full-stack application development
and control systems design and optimisation.

My background is in high-energy theoretical physics,
having attained a PhD from the Durham University, UK,
specialising in gravitation.

My scientific interests have included the thermodynamic properties of black holes,
the relationship between gravitational theories and quantum field theories,
and simulation of the lensing of light by strong gravitational fields.
