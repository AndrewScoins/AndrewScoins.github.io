You've stumbled across the website of Andrew Scoins.

This site is intended as a repository for my CV and contact information.
I may use it as a dumping ground for comments and short essays
on topics in software development, physics, and mathematics in the future.
I may even use it as a launchpad to access software repositories,
if I ever write anything non-proprietary.

## About Me

I'm a scientific software developer and navigational systems algorithm
engineer at [GMV](https://www.gmv.com/en). My work covers both full-stack application development
and control systems design and optimisation.

My background is in high-energy theoretical physics,
having attained a PhD from [Durham University, UK](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/mathematical-sciences/),
specialising in gravitation.

My scientific interests have included the thermodynamic properties of black holes,
the relationship between gravitational theories and quantum field theories,
and trajectory computation in strong gravitational fields.
