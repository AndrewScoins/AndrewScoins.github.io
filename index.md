# 1. Welcome!

You've stumbled across the website of Andrew Scoins.

This site is intended as a repository for my CV and contact information.
I may use it as a dumping ground for comments and short essays 
on topics in software development, physics, and mathematics in the future.
I may even use it as a launchpad to access software repositories,
if I ever write anything non-proprietary.

## About Me

I'm a scientific software developer and navigational systems algorithm
engineer at GMV. My work covers both full-stack application development
and control systems design and optimisation.

My background is in high-energy theoretical physics,
having attained a PhD from the Durham University, UK,
specialising in gravitation.

My scientific interests have included the thermodynamic properties of black holes,
the relationship between gravitational theories and quantum field theories,
and simulation of the lensing of light by strong gravitational fields.
