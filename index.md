# Welcome

You've stumbled across the website of Andrew Scoins.

I'm a software developer with the graphics team at [Datapath](https://www.datapath.co.uk/).

This site is intended as a repository for my CV and contact information.
I may use it as a dumping ground for comments and short essays on topics in software development, physics, and mathematics in the future.
